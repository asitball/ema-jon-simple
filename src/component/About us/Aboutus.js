            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>The Daily Star established its place in the media scene of Bangladesh on January 14, 1991. It started its journey with a sense of challenge <br/> and a feeling of humility to serve this nation as a truly independent newspaper.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The newspaper made its debut at a historic time when, with the fall of an autocratic regime, the country was well set to begin a new era <br/> towards establishing a democratic system of government which eluded Bangladesh for too long.</p>
            <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
            <p>The Daily Star carries on with the long-term responsibility is to strengthen public opinion on how the democratic system should work <br/> and how to sustain and nurture democratic norms effectively.</p>
            <p>It was a privilege for The Daily Star to be part of a changing scene after the fall of military autocrat in early 1990s. With that privilege <br/> came an enormous responsibility of upholding the duties of a free press. The newspaper is proud to pursue that policy without <br/> relenting for the past 23 years.</p>
            <h4>VALUES</h4>
            <p>The uniqueness of The Daily Star lies in its non-partisan position, in the freedom it enjoys from any influence of political parties or <br/>
             vested groups. Its strength is in taking position of neutrality in conflicts between good and evil, justice and injustice, right and wrong, <br/>
              regardless of positions held by any group or alliance.</p>
